# Bots
Here we have multiple python bots
1. MainRSIbot_1.py connects to the binance exchange and trades based on the rsi strategy.
2. mybotpercent_1.py is a copy of MainRSIbot but it trades based on how high or low the price of a coin changed by percentage.
3. newrsistrategy_1.py is also a copy of MainRSIbot but it buys and sells multiple times depending on the change od the rsi.
4. insta.py logs in with an account and likes up to 40 likes on a tag or specific account.
